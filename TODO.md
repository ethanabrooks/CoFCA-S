- regenerate graphs with translucent reward vs. opaque progress.
- generate compound generalization graph
- include generalization to condition length graph
- generate generalization lengths 11-15 graphs (for no-roll and no-pointer)
- rerun generalization by length baselines and generate graphs.
- spruce up the Example instruction diagram
- analysis??
