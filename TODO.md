- update captions
- write analysis of simple-rewards graph
- generate generalization lengths 11-15 graphs (for no-roll and no-pointer)
- analysis??
- spruce up the Example instruction diagram
- debug conditions when counts are equal
- debug save intervals
- rerun generalization by length baselines and generate graphs.
